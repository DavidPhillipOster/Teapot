Martin [Newell's Teapot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_teapot) in OpenSCAD

This is a work in progress.

It does in fact, use BOSL2 to render the classic teapot,

but because I haven't closed off the ends to make watertight, manifold, shapes
OpenSCAD can't render it for printing.

6/07/2024 - I've made the handle and spout watertight, manifold, shapes that OpenSCAD can render.
